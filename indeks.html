                <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
               <p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance and scalability.
With a solid grasp of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and frameworks like **React** and **Bootstrap**, I bring ideas to life through clean, efficient code. On the back end, I'm familiar with **Node.js**, **PHP**, and working with databases like **MySQL** or **MongoDB**, enabling me to build full-stack solutions from scratch.
I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and creating seamless digital experiences that align with user needs and business goals. Whether it's crafting a personal portfolio, developing an e-commerce platform, or optimizing site speed, I take pride in every line of code I write.</p>

                    <h4>UI / UX Design</h4>
                    <p>When it comes to UI and UX design, I focus on creating interfaces that not only look good but feel intuitive and easy to use. I believe design should guide the user, not confuse them, so I prioritize clarity, consistency, and responsiveness across all screen sizes. From wireframing and layout planning to implementing clean visual design, my goal is to make sure every element serves a purpose. I pay attention to how users interact with a product, 
                making sure the experience is smooth, accessible, and aligned with real-world behavior because good design isn’t just about how it looks, but how it works.</p>

                    <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
                    <p>I specialize in building responsive and visually appealing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
My focus is on delivering clean, efficient front-end code that ensures smooth user experiences across all devices and browsers. 
I often work with modern libraries and frameworks like React to develop dynamic, interactive components that bring designs to life. I also prioritize accessibility, performance optimization, and creating layouts that are both functional and intuitive.

                    <h4>Backend Development</h4>
                    <p>On the back end, I develop and maintain the core functionality that powers web applications. I work with technologies like Node.js, Express, and PHP to build APIs, handle server logic, and manage databases like MongoDB and MySQL. My goal is to write scalable, secure, and maintainable code that supports seamless data flow and smooth integration with the front end. 
                 I’m comfortable with user authentication, RESTful services, and deploying full-stack applications from start to finish.

                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>Created an AI tool that automates resume screening using machine learning and text classification. It parses resumes (PDF/DOCX), extracts key information (skills, experience, education), and matches candidates to job descriptions using a TF-IDF + cosine similarity model. The tool significantly reduced manual HR effort and provided a ranked list of best-fit candidates.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>Developed an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with tools like Dialogflow and Python (NLTK / spaCy) to handle customer queries for an e-commerce platform. The bot could understand user intent, provide order updates, recommend products, and escalate complex issues to human agents. It was integrated with a web interface and deployed via REST API, resulting in a 40% reduction in customer service load.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3</h3>
                    <p>Built a computer vision–based attendance system using OpenCV, FaceNet, and Dlib, capable of recognizing and verifying individuals in real time via webcam. The system automatically logs attendance by comparing live facial data with stored embeddings, improving accuracy and reducing time compared to manual systems. It included an admin dashboard built with Flask for data visualization and logs management</p>

                    <h3>Project 4</h3>
                    <p>Designed a web-based application that detects fake news articles using a logistic regression model trained on labeled datasets. The system uses NLP techniques (text cleaning, stemming, vectorization) and evaluates articles in real time, flagging suspicious content based on linguistic patterns and metadata. It was built with Streamlit and deployed on Heroku for public use.</p>

                    <h3>Project 5</h3>
                    <p>Developed a deep learning model that generates human-like captions for images using a combination of CNNs (ResNet50) for image feature extraction and LSTMs for natural language generation. Trained on the MS COCO dataset, the model could describe complex images with reasonable accuracy. The project also included a simple front-end interface where users could upload images and get instant AI-generated captions.</p>

                    <h3>Project 6</h3>
                    <p>Built a recommendation engine using both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. It analyzed user behavior and movie metadata to recommend films tailored to individual tastes. Implemented with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, the system featured a web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to log in, rate movies, and get new suggestions in real time.</p>
